        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Note that you can skip this step if you’re not using fresh leaves and are using jarred ones instead. 
                    If using jarred leaves, just drain them, set them aside, and go to step 2.
                     If you’re using fresh leaves, keep reading
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, bring a pot of boiling water to the boil.
                     Once the water is ready, add all of your leaves into the pot. 
                </p>

                <p>You’ll need to let the leaves boil for around 1-2 minutes until they change color. 
                    Make sure the leaves are submerged in the boiling water.</p>
                <p>After 1-2 minutes, using a slotted spoon, take them out and lay them to rest on a plate.</p>
                <img src="https://nomadparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/273_05-768x512.jpg.webp" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    With your leaves resting, it’s time to start making the filling to stuff in the leaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, prep the ingredients. Dice the onions. 
                    Shred the cabbage and the carrots. Get everything else ready to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, put a pan on medium heat and add olive oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add the shredded cabbage and carrots to the pan, 
                    and cook the mixture over medium heat, for around 10 minutes.
                </p>
                <img src="https://nomadparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/273_07-768x512.jpg.webp" alt="">
                <p>
                    While your diced and shredded vegetables are cooking, 
                    you have time to prepare both the meat and rice, ready to add to the pan in due course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, take the meat, and either dice it into small cubes or mince it, 
                    depending on preference. We prefer it diced in small cubes. Set it aside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, rinse the rice in a strainer under running water until the water seeping through is clear. Place the rice in a pot, pour boiling water over it, 
                    and leave it to rest for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, strain it and set it aside. 
                </p>
                <img src="https://nomadparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/273_08-768x512.jpg.webp" alt="">
                <p>
                    By now, the vegetables in the pan should be cooking away nicely, creating a colorful, 
                    earthy vegetable mixture that will form the base of your filling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the 10 minutes passed since you started cooking the onion-carrot-cabbage mixture, 
                    add the tomato puree or passata to the pan, and mix it into the vegetables, as shown below.
                </p>
                <img src="https://nomadparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/273_10-768x512.jpg.webp" alt="">
                <p>
                    As soon as the tomato passata has been added, add the spices (salt, pepper, summer savory or thyme, oregano, and paprika), 
                    and cook the whole mixture for 2-3 minutes, stirring it as you go, as shown below.
                </p>
                <img src="https://nomadparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/273_12-768x512.jpg.webp" alt="">
                <p>
                    Now take the diced or minced meat, and add it to the pan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cook for around 5 minutes, letting the meat brown and mix with the vegetables and the spices,
                     as shown below. After five 5 minutes, turn the heat off.

                </p>
                <p>
                    With the heat off, take your drained rice and simply add it to the pan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mix everything together to create your rich, 
                    hearty, and delicious filling, ready to be stuffed into the grape leaves.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    With your filling ready, now comes the fun part: rolling your stuffed grape leaves. 
                    The video below shows you how to do it in a way that seals the leaves, so that the filling won’t pop out when cooking. 
                    You’ll notice these are rolled differently from the 
                    Greek/Turkish/Mediterranean versions (which are more like small cylinders). 
                </p>

        </p>
            <p>
                Before you start rolling, have your pot that you will cook your stuffed grapes leaves in ready by your side, 
                so as soon as you roll your leaves, you can place them in the pot. 
                Line the bottom with a few cabbage leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
                It takes a little practice, but you have plenty of leaves and stuffing to get through,
                 so don’t worry if it takes you a few attempts to get it right.
                 It can take some time to roll all of your stuffed cabbage leaves, so make yourself comfortable. 
                 Maybe put some music or a show on, or get someone to help you.
                 In time, your pot will be filled with delicious wrapped grape leaves, as shown below.
            </p>
            <img src="https://nomadparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/273_20-768x512.jpg.webp" alt="">
            <p>
                Once all of your stuffed leaves are in the pot, add 400ml (about 1 and ¾ cups) of water to the pot. 
                Finally, cover the top with a handful of cabbage leaves and cover with a lid 
            </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake at 200° Celsius (390 Fahrenheit) for about 20 minutes. 
                Then turn the temperature down to 180° Celsius (350 Fahrenheit) and bake for an hour.</p>
                <p>
                    Once the stuffed grape leaves are ready, they will be a deep, dark green in color.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Get a large serving plate, and get your stuffed leaves out of the pot, and stack them on the plate.
                    The rich, green color and the creased, crisp exterior of the stuffed leaves are beautiful to behold, 
                    particularly when glistening under the kitchen or dining room light.
                </p>

                    But inside these little pockets is where the true magic lies. 
                    Pick one up, bite in, and prepare for a release of richness, 
                    heat, and spice, which will get you hooked from the first mouthful.
